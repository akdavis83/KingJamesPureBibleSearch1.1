			<ul>
			<li>Works on Windows, Linux, and Mac and other devices sporting a compatible browser and input/output mechanism<br><br></li>
			<li>Runs and has been tested on Firefox, Chrome, and Safari.  However, it will only run on the most latest of these
				browsers from 2017 and later (and in some cases 2019 and later), as WebAssembly is a very new technology.<br><br></li>
			<li>It in theory should work on iOS and Android mobile devices.  However, thus far it has only proven that it
				doesn't work on mobile.  If you do get it to work on either an Android or iOS device, please write me with
				the exact operating system version and browser version used, and I'll update this list accordingly.<br><br></li>
			<li>Be patient for it to load!  The Download Size is about 100megs.  Download Time depends on your internet
				connection speed.  For a high speed connection, it's about 5-10 seconds on average.  However, once it
				is downloaded, your computer must compile and run the WebAssembly code.  The time it takes for your
				computer to compile and run it depends on your computer's speed.  This is normal and average load time
				is about 15-20 seconds for most computers.<br><br></li>
			<li>Window state and settings aren't saved.  These will default back to their initial settings each time you
				start Pure Bible Search Web Assembly Online.  This is functionally the same as running the desktop application
				in &quot;stealth&quot; mode.<br><br></li>
			<li>Has Limited Fonts and Settings - since all fonts and configuration details must be downloaded from the
				server, fonts have been limited to a handful of DejaVu Sans and Serif TrueType fonts, the same ones that ship
				with the desktop version.<br><br></li>
			<li>Since the program is running inside a sandbox within the browser, it is difficult, if not
				impossible, for it to access data files on your system's hard drive.  Therefore, this is a
				&quot;Lite Version&quot; and doesn't have support for the User Notes Files.  In other words, you will
				not be able to highlight text, add/edit custom notes, or add/edit cross-references.  If it were to
				let you do those things, you'd lose them when you exit your browser, so that has just been disabled.<br><br></li>
			<li>This online version DOES support having multiple search windows open.  But note that when you
				click on Window-&gt;New Search Window, the new window will appear right on top of your existing window.  You
				will need to use the Window menu to switch between search windows.<br><br></li>
			<li>Note that because this is running in a sandboxed environment, it does NOT have normal access to your
				computer's clipboard (for the same reason it can't access arbitrary files on your computer).  This
				is a security mechanism within your browser to keep viruses from spreading via clipboard
				embedding or from websites spying on your clipboard content.  But, it means copying and pasting to/from the
				program is difficult and will vary based on browser support for exchanging clipboard content.<br><br>
				Pasting text between elements within the KJPBS app seem to work just fine, but not for text to/from the
				host computer environment except in a few limited scenarios.  I am currently investigating workarounds
				for this limitation.<br><br></li>
			<li>WebAssembly itself is essentially the next generation of Emscripten.  The original Emscripten-Qt version
				of KJPBS was with KJPBS cross-compiled to Javascript and running in your browser.  WebAssembly takes that
				one step further and compiles it to an intermediate language that is run within your browser.
